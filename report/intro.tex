\section*{Introduction}

Automated news generation (often called automated journalism or robot journalism) refers to software producing news from data with minimal human input \cite{acl_anthology}.
Early NLG systems in newsrooms were largely template-based, using predefined phrases filled with data (e.g., finance or sports reports) \cite{acl_anthology}.
Recent advances in deep learning and especially the Transformer architecture have greatly improved the ability to generate coherent, contextually accurate narratives from structured data \cite{arxiv_transformer}.
For example, Leppänen et al. (2017) developed a data-driven NLG system that produced thousands of localized election news articles in multiple languages \cite{acl_anthology}.
These systems highlight the potential of automated content creation, but also underscore requirements like transparency, accuracy, and adaptability in journalistic contexts \cite{acl_anthology}.
Ensuring factual correctness and neutrality is paramount – research notes that maintaining objectivity and avoiding bias remain significant challenges for AI-generated news \cite{arxiv_bias}.
Modern LLMs, with their ability to generate fluent text, are now being explored as core engines for such NLG tasks.

This dataset in question for this paper are short traffic news reports.
It includes periodically sampled data from the website of the Slovenian national motorway management company and reports that are broadcasted on a public radio station.
The objective is to enhance a large language model's (LLM's) ability to generate reports that align seamlessly with the style and structure of the provided input data by utilizing the appropriate natural processing techniques.
