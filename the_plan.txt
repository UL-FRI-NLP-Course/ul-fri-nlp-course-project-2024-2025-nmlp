data preparation
    DP1: finding most similar output data point to given input (anze)
    DP2: construction of completely overlapping io pairs (jan)
fine-tuning (FT)
    figure out how it even works
    run FT and get weights for DP1
    run FT and get weights for DP2
evaluation
    construct evaluation model/metric
        how well the output matches the given input
        how well the output followes guidelines (PROMET.docx)
        e.g. use GPT for this task
    evaluation of baseline results
        i.e. LLM + prompt engineering, without fine-tuning (FT)
    evaluation of FT results
        for DP1
        for DP2
